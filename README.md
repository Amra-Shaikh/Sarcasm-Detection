# Sarcasm Detection App

This repository contains a Python-based Sarcasm Detection application designed to analyze and determine the presence of sarcasm in text. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify sarcasm within sentences, which is often challenging due to the nuanced and context-driven nature of sarcastic statements.

## Background

Detecting sarcasm in text is a complex NLP problem due to the subtleties of human language and the frequent lack of explicit clues. Sarcasm often relies on social and cultural context, which makes it challenging for automated systems to accurately classify it. This application aims to build a foundational sarcasm detection tool that can be fine-tuned with additional data for improved accuracy.

## Features

- **Real-time Sarcasm Detection**: Analyzes text inputs and classifies whether they are sarcastic.
- **Machine Learning-Based Approach**: Utilizes NLP models for pattern recognition in sarcasm.
- **Configurable and Extendable**: Can be modified with additional datasets and models to improve performance.

## Project Structure

The core project structure includes the following components:

- **`pythonProject1/app2.py`**: The main application script to execute the sarcasm detection functionality.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python libraries and dependencies needed for the project.
- **`.idea/`**: Contains IDE-specific configuration files (for PyCharm).
- **`commands.txt`**: May include useful command-line instructions for running and testing the app.

## Installation

To set up the Sarcasm Detection App on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Amra-Shaikh/Sarcasm-Detection
    cd Sarcasm-Detection
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the Sarcasm Detection App as follows:

1. **Run the main application**:
    ```bash
    python pythonProject1/app2.py
    ```

2. **Input Text**: Enter sentences or paragraphs to determine if they contain sarcasm.
3. **Output**: The application will display a result indicating whether the input text is classified as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.

## Examples

Here are some example inputs and expected outputs from the app:

| Input Text                                       | Expected Output      |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| "Oh, great! Another rainy day. Just what I needed." | Sarcastic         |  |
| "I had a wonderful dinner last night."           | Non-sarcastic        |

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:

1. **Dependency Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install any missing libraries.
2. **Python Version Compatibility**: The application is developed for Python 3.7+. Check your Python version with `python --version`.
3. **Virtual Environment Issues**: If using a virtual environment, confirm that it is activated before running the app.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some potential enhancements for this project:

- **Improved Sarcasm Detection Model**: Train on larger and more diverse datasets for better performance.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Add a GUI for easier interaction.
- **API Integration**: Create an API endpoint for sarcasm detection to allow integration with other applications.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application as a web service for broader access.
